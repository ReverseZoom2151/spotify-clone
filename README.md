## Technologies Used

The Spotify clone leverages a variety of modern technologies to deliver a seamless music streaming experience. Below is a detailed list of the key technologies and tools used in this project:

- **[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)**: A React framework for server-side rendering and static site generation. It provides a powerful routing system, optimized performance, and developer-friendly features.
- **[Supabase](https://supabase.com/)**: An open-source Firebase alternative that provides a complete backend solution, including a PostgreSQL database, real-time subscriptions, user authentication, and file storage.
- **[React](https://reactjs.org/)**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React's component-based architecture and hooks make it easy to build reusable UI components and manage state effectively.
- **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)**: A utility-first CSS framework that allows you to build custom designs directly in your markup. It provides a highly customizable and responsive design system.
- **[Zustand](https://zustand.surge.sh/)**: A small, fast, and scalable state management solution for React. Zustand is used for managing global states, such as the visibility of modals in the application.
- **[React Hot Toast](https://react-hot-toast.com/)**: A lightweight and customizable toast notification library for React. It provides easy-to-use APIs for showing success, error, and informational messages.
- **[Stripe](https://stripe.com/)**: A powerful and secure payment processing platform. Stripe is integrated to manage subscriptions and handle payments securely.
- **[React Icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/)**: A collection of popular icons as React components. This library is used to add scalable vector icons to the application for better UI/UX.

Each of these technologies has been carefully chosen to provide a robust, scalable, and maintainable codebase, allowing for a rich feature set and a smooth user experience.
